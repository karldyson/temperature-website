# Introduction

This is a really basic website that grabs the current temperature from prometheus and displays a table.

The idea was that now that I'm capturing the various temperatures around the house and outside, I could have a quick bookmark on the home screen of my phone to see how cold it is outside.

The outside temperature is displayed underneath the table.

If you spin your phone to landscape, it adds columns for minimum and maximum over the last 24h.

The current temperature has an arrow next to it to tell you if the temp is (over the last 15 minutes) going up, down or remaining where it is.

CSS is not my strong point, so this might be awful. Sorry about that.

This is designed to work with the following other repos:

* [RPi Pico Temperature Monitoring](https://github.com/karldyson/pico-temperature)
* [Prometheus Temperature Exporter](https://github.com/karldyson/prometheus_temperature_exporter)

There are [blog articles](https://karld.blog/tags/temperature) that talk about them.
